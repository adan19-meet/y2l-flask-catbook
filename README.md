## Before you code: Try to understand the codebase
This repository is a sample flask app for the famous Catbook, the world's next most famous website, where you can see Cats play piano, eat ice cream, and rock the best hair cuts. 

This app uses a lot of the tools we have learned ove the yearlong, bootstrap, databases, and flask. Make sure you understand how these different components interact. If you have questions, this is a good time to ask a TA or an instructor

After you have an idea about the app, start the server by running `python app.py`

## The lab
### Part 1: Cat's detail page

### Part 2: Implement adding a new Cat

### Part 3: Implementing a vote function

Bonus: change the order of how cats are displayed on the home page to show the most popular cat first (notice how models.py has a relevant attribute for this)

### Part 4: Implemening search
In the header, you can see there is a search text box, implement a functionlity where you can write a cat's name in the search text box and it will return all the cats that match that name
